### **Project Description**  

This project is the final deliverable for the **DEPI-Fortinet Cyber Security Engineer (Round 1)** program. It demonstrates the practical implementation of advanced network security measures to design and secure a robust network infrastructure.  

The project integrates a variety of industry-standard technologies and configurations to address real-world cybersecurity challenges in both wired and wireless networks. It focuses on applying layered security controls across the topology to enhance protection, segment traffic, and safeguard critical assets.  

**Key highlights of the project include:**  
1. **VLAN Implementation**: Logical segmentation to isolate network traffic and reduce broadcast domains.  
2. **IPSec VPN**: Securing communication over untrusted networks through encrypted tunnels.  
3. **802.1X Authentication**: Implementing port-based access control to ensure only authenticated devices connect to the network.  
4. **TACACS+ and RADIUS**: Centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting for both device access and wireless users.  
5. **ASA Firewall and ZPF**: Combining perimeter and zone-based firewalls for comprehensive traffic filtering and policy enforcement.  
6. **WLAN Security**: Configuring secure wireless connectivity using WPA2/WPA3 with authentication protocols.  
7. **EtherChannel**: Aggregating physical links for redundancy and enhanced performance.  
8. **STP Security**: Strengthening Layer 2 protection with features like BPDU Guard and root guard.  
9. **IP Source Guard**: Mitigating spoofing attacks to secure the Layer 2 domain.  
10. **Disabling CDP**: Preventing network reconnaissance by disabling Cisco Discovery Protocol on non-essential interfaces.  

**Devices used in the project include:**  
- Cisco ISR 4321 routers, Catalyst 2960 switches, and ASA 5506-X firewall.  
- End devices such as PCs, tablets, and laptops.  
- Network services including TACACS+, RADIUS, DNS, HTTP, and Mail servers.  
- Wireless Access Points for WLAN implementation.  

This comprehensive setup and configuration showcase the application of Fortinet and Cisco technologies to build a secure, scalable, and efficient network. The project not only highlights technical proficiency but also demonstrates a deep understanding of cybersecurity principles required to excel as a network security engineer.
